# boost::rtree test & visualization

- This is a simple test about boost::rtree: use rtree to build spatial index for a list of boxes (bounding boxes generated by OASIS/GDS file).
- The glut folder is a visualization test by using glut library.
- test data: str_bbox_data.txt, str_10950_ref_bbox.txt
- environment
  + boost: v 1.59 and v1.57
  + gcc: v3.4.5 and v4.4.7
- During my testing, I compared the performance about building up rtree by using different algo provided by boost::rtree, and found the performance is affected by gcc version and compiling option greately (Please refer to [stack overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37068950/boostrtree-is-affected-by-gcc-compiler-greatly/) ).
